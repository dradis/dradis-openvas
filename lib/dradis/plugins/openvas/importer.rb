      # uses the full <description> field:

      #      <description>Detected Apache Tomcat version: 2.2.22
      #       Location: 80/tcp
      #       CPE: cpe:/a:apache:http_server:2.2.22

      #         OpenBSD has released a patch to address this issue.

      # Best thing to do is to include the full <description> field and let the user deal with it.
